# Introduction 

Haywood et al (1999) made some great meausurements of BBOA  over the Sahara.
We add to these meausurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.  
It reproduces growthn in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology

We used AMS (Allan et al 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical compositions.

# Conclusions

We made some groundbreaking discovery, aren't we great. Give us more funding.
