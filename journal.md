# Abstract

We write this last because it is difficult to do.  This is where we summarise our main reuslts so lazy people do not have to read
the whole thing but can still reference it.

# Introduction 

Haywood et al (1999) made some great meausurements of BBOA  over the Sahara.
We add to these meausurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.  
It reproduces growthn in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology

We used AMS (Allan et al 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical compositions.

# Results

We observed particle growth through coagulation, and report the changing chemical composition with age in the atmosphere.

# Conclusions

We made some groundbreaking discovery, aren't we great. Give us more funding.

# Figures

This is where the figures go in a draft manuscript.

# Aknowledgements

We woudl like to thank the EU funding body, for their support. RIP :( (?)

I'd like to thank Sam too!
